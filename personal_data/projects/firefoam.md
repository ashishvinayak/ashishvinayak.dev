During the Master's thesis, we explored the possibility of using OpenFOAM (A C++ Framework) to perform mass and energy transfer across coupled solid and fluid regions. The exploration led to development of new boundary conditions to enable pyrolysis and flame spread simulations. The results were compared to experiments and a bruteforce inverse parameter optimization was performed to fit the simulation to experimental data.

A full documentation and relevant code for it can be found below:
