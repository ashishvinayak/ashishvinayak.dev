Hi, my name is Ashish. I am a computational scientist living between Wuppertal and Berlin in Germany. 

Besides doing multiphase simulations, I interest myself in software development and climate science.
Additionally, I like exploring hidden interests like Jekyll.

These pages are under construction.

You can contact me via Xing, LinkedIn and Instagram at the moment.
