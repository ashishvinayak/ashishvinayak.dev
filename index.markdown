Hi, I'm Ashish. I am a computer engineer living in Berlin, Germany. 

I have spent a bunch of my time modelling simulations of processes such as combustion, pyrolysis (melting) and collisions.
Additionally, I have worked a bit in the IoT department developing dashboards and content management systems.

Besides information sciences, I interest myself in software architecture, climate science and bouldering.

You can contact me via Xing, LinkedIn and Instagram.
