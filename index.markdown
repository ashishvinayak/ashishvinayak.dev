<h2>Hey, I'm Ashish!</h2> 

<div align="justify">
I am a computer engineer living in Berlin, Germany. 
In 2014, I moved from Germany from India with a passion to work in technology to solve real world problems.
I have written code all my life, starting in the 8th grade with HTML. My passion in programming really took off during my masters program
where I was able to make Mathematics and Computers meet.

<br><br>
I am a quick learner, and best learn by doing. I believe in writing modular, minimal and maintainable code 
and pride myself in being able to transfer knowledge between various topics to enable myself to look at a bigger picture.
Knowledge should be free and accessible to all, I have tried to keep my work open-source where ever I have been allowed to do so. 
<br><br>
Apart from this, I find a lot of joy in meeting new people, bouldering (a rock climbing sport), guitars, climate science, and food.
