<h2>Hey, I'm Ashish!</h2> 
<div align="justify" style="margin-left: 5pt;">
I am a computer engineer living in Berlin, Germany. 
In 2014, I moved from India to Germany with a passion to work in technology to help solve challenging and relevant problems.
I have written code all my life, starting in the 8th grade with HTML! My passion for programming really took off during my masters program
where I was able to make Mathematics and Computers meet. 
<br><br>
I am a quick learner, and best learn by doing. I believe in writing modular, minimal and maintainable code 
and pride myself in being able to transfer knowledge between various areas to enable myself to look at a bigger picture.
I think that, knowledge should be free and accessible to all. I have tried to keep my work open-source wherever I have been able to do so. 
<br><br>
Apart from work, I find a lot of joy in meeting new people, bouldering (a rock climbing sport), guitars, climate science, and trying out new food.
