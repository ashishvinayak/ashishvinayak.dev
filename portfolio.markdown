        At IVU Traffic Technologies, Berlin, I am a part of a team of 20 developers, who are jointly responsible for writing and maintaining modern C++ software
        for the planning and disposition of public transport vehicles. I, specifically work in a subteam that enables the planning of future tasks for vehicles
        upon arrival at a depot. Besides this, I have taken a strong interest in becoming competent in Qt, and worked closely with the UX expert to improve the interface 
        by implementing several complex View functionalities within the software.
        The work at IVU has exposed me to an extremely large codebase, and an outstanding design architecture, enabling me to think and write better, and more maintenable code.

    <div class="project-summary">
        At 5micron GmbH, Berlin, I was a part of a team of three developers and was responsible for the development of a User- and Content Management
        System for the control of IoT Devices. The primary task was to design a user-registration and login system for which I employed Json Web Tokens (JWT) 
        as the authorisation technique. Additionally, the control of IoT devices allowed creating and deleting devices, on-the-fly label management for the devices and user 
        users management. The project enabled me to design a modular database architecture and exposed me to the development of Restful APIs using PHP and Javascript.

        An energy efficient cleaning process would enable removal of particles
        from a surface without the need to expend (or waste) a large amount of water.
        The hypothesis was tested by modelling the collisions between particles and droplets and 
        compared to experiments. 
        The three year project was sponsored by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi).

        We developed a Python module PROPTI for optimisation of parameters in computer simulations.
        PROPTI provides a framework that is easy to understand, well documented and generalised to work alongside 
        any simulation software to enable parameter estimation. 
        <br>
        PROPTI is open-source, released under the MIT License and available on <a href="https://github.com/FireDynamics/propti">GitHub</a>.

        The project investigated the numerical modeling and simulation of pyrolysis and flame spread using OpenFOAM.
        OpenFOAM is a C++ Framework used for simulation of fluid flows, and in general, physical phenomenon occurring in nature.
        A new method was developed to understand how the mass of a material changes when it starts burning, the results of the simulation
        were compared to experiments performed at the University of Wuppertal, Germany.
        <br>
        The C++ code and documentation are open source and can be accessed on <a href="https://github.com/ashishvinayak/fireFoamBoundaryConditions">GitHub</a> and
