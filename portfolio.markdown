        At 5micron GmbH, Berlin, I was a part of a team of three and was responsible for the development of a website that enabled 
        users to register themselves and access specific parts based on their privileges in the client's organization. I was additionally tasked with 
        developing a Content Management System (CMS) to allow users to manage their IoT devices such as sensors.
        The project enabled me to design a highly modular database architecture for User- and Content Management and exposed me to the development of 
        Restful APIs in PHP and Javascript.

        An energy efficient cleaning process would enable removal of particles
        from a surface without the need to expend (or waste) a large amount of water.
        The hypothesis was tested by modelling the collisions between particles and droplets and 
        compared to experiments. 
        The three year project was sponsored by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi).

        We developed a Python module PROPTI for optimisation of parameters in computer simulations.
        PROPTI provides a framework that is easy to understand, well documented and generalised to work alongside 
        any simulation software to enable parameter estimation. 
        <br>
        PROPTI is open-source, released under the MIT License and available on <a href="https://github.com/FireDynamics/propti">GitHub</a>.

        The project investigated the numerical modeling and simulation of pyrolysis and flame spread using OpenFOAM.
        OpenFOAM is a C++ Framework used for simulation of fluid flows, and in general, physical phenomenon occurring in nature.
        A new method was developed to understand how the mass of a material changes when it starts burning, the results of the simulation
        were compared to experiments performed at the University of Wuppertal, Germany.

        The C++ code and documentation are open source and can be accessed on <a href="https://github.com/ashishvinayak/fireFoamBoundaryConditions">GitHub</a> and
